# Climate Change Data Analysis

This project analyzes key climate variables over time using real-world data. It explores trends in global temperature, CO₂ emissions, sea level rise, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed from the year 2000 onwards.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains yearly measurements of important climate indicators. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis:

- Cleans and preprocesses the data.
- Computes yearly averages for the climate variables.
- Visualizes trends and relationships between variables.
- Calculates the temperature trend per year, revealing subtle but impactful changes.
- Presents correlation matrices and time series plots to better understand climate dynamics.

## Key Highlights

- Temperature trend identified as approximately **-0.0064 °C per year**.
- Clear positive correlation between CO₂ emissions and temperature rise.
- Insightful visualizations including heatmaps, line plots, scatterplots with trend lines.
- Thorough exploration providing a foundation for further climate research.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`climate_analysis.ipynb`) to explore the code and visualizations.
3. Ensure dependencies are installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
4. Run the notebook step-by-step to understand the data analysis process.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
